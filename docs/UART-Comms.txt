Overview:
	See flowchart diagram
	
	Parameters in instructions are seperated by ","
	Bool = 1/0 bit


EZ-B to Atmega328p(MCU1) -- UART:
	Structure:
		1. Data Direction
		2. Datatype
		3. Type ending
		4. Data/Instruction
		5. End

	Definitions:
		Data Direction:
			“E” is sent if data or an instruction is to be sent by the EZ-B or a request for data is sent from MCU1
			“M” is sent if data or an instruction is to be sent by MCU1 or a request for data is sent from EZ-B

		Datatype:
			0-399 are reserved for instructions
			400-999 are reserved for datatypes

			1. "000" for Reset instruction
			2. "001" for Low-power instruction
			3. "002" for Move instruction
			 etc according to guide below
			
		Type Ending
			"|" is sent after the datatype
			
		Data/Instruction
			Data is sent according to structures set out below. Different values are seperated by ","
			
		End
			End is signified by sending "|ENDSTREAMEND|"


			
Instruction Definitions
	Reset (000)
	Resets specified components of robot
		(Int)Components to reset: 0=ALL, 1=Motor Drivers, 2=Arm Driver
	
	Low-power (001)
	Puts robot in specified low-power mode
		(Int)Power mode to enter: 0=Shutdown, 1=Motors off, 2=Lights off
	
	Move (002)
	Moves bot by parameter
		(Float)Rotations of wheel to complete
		(Int)Speed: 0-127
		(Bool)Report back when done
		(Bool)Report after every rotation
		
	Rotate (003)
	Rotates bot by parameter
		(Signed Int)Rotation in degrees CLOCKWISE
		(Int) Speed: 0-127
		(Bool)Report back when done
		
	Collision Report Mode (004)
	Puts Bot in collision reporting mode that sends collision as data to computer
		(Bool)Report any collision
		
	Home request (005)
	Requests server to recalibrate
		(Bool)Give Request, false=Cancel request
		
	
		
Data Definitions
	Battery (400)
	Battery level
		(Int)Battery level of Electronics battery: 0-100
		(Int)Battery Level of Motor battery: 0-100
	
	Collision (401)
	Collision Detected
		(Int)Collision detected by: 0=Sharp1, 1=Sharp2, 2=Button1, 3=Button2, 4=Button3, 5=Button4, 6=Button5
		
	Rotations completed (402)
	Gives the amount of rotations completed and whether it prematurely finished
		(Float)Amount of rotations completed since last move instruction.
		(Bool)Robot detected obstacle, false=robot finished move instruction.
		

Examples
	To reset bot motor drivers: E000|1|ENDSTREAMEND|
	Multiple instructions:
		Move bot with parameter - rotate 30.2 rotations, at 50 speed, report back when done but do not report after each rotation: E002|30.2,50,1,0|ENDSTREAMEND|
