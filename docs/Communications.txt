EZ-B to Atmega328p(MCU1) -- UART:

	Structure:
		I. Data Direction
		II. Datatype
		III. Type ending
		IV. Data/Instruction
		V. End

	Definitions:
		Data Direction:
			“E” is sent if data or an instruction is to be sent by the EZ-B or a request for data is sent from MCU1
			“M” is sent if data or an instruction is to be sent by MCU1 or a request for data is sent from EZ-B

		Datatype:
			0-29 are reserved for instructions
			30-99 are reserved for datatypes

			I. "01" for Move instruction
			
		Type Ending
			"ENDDATA" is sent after the datatype
			
		Data/Instruction
			Data is sent according to structures set out below. Different values are seperated by ","
